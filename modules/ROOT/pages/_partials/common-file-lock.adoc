== File Locks

File system level locks are not possible in FTP or SFTP, so each operation uses a Mule lock that only protects the file from other flows in the same Mule application. These locks do not protect the file from external processes. However, if the Mule app is running on a cluster, the lock is distributed.

The file lock is automatically released when one of the following  occurs:

* The Mule flow that locked the file ends.
* The file content has been fully read.

Note: If the file is already locked by someone else, the connector cannot unlock it, and you then receive a `FTP:FILE_LOCK` error.
