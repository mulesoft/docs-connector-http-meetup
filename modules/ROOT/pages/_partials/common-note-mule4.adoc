== Notes on Mule 4 Behavior (for Mule 3 Users)

* The examples above use the File connector to read a file in the middle of the flow. The information posted through the `<http:listener>` component is written to each FTP or SFTP site multiple times. Because the component makes use of the xref:4.1@mule-runtime::streaming-about.adoc[repeatable streams feature], you do not need to worry about consuming the stream multiple times.

* The `<foreach>` component automatically goes through each line of the CSV file. In Mule 3, you had to transform the CSV file into a Java structure, but because Mule 4 is language independent, you can transform the file without first casting the CSV content as a Java structure.
