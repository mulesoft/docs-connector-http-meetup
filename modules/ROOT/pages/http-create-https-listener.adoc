This procedure describes how to create an HTTPS Listener secured by TLS 1.2. The Listener responds to an HTTPS URL that you enter in a browser to start an app.

. Create a new project, and in Trigger, select HTTP.
. Edit the Listener configuration.
+
* In Configuration Name, accept the default name.
* In Protocol, select HTTPS.
* Set the host = *0.0.0.0*.
* Set the port = *8082*.
+
On the CloudHub HTTP configuration, the port needs to be 8082.
+
* Click TLS, and configure TLS as described in "Workflow: Configuring TLS."
* Accept the default no base path.
. In General, set Path to the path of the HTTP URL. For example, enter */tls-listener*.
. In Advanced, set Allowed Methods to GET. Accept the other default settings and close the configuration.
. Add logic to the flow to create an app. For example, add another HTTP Request to consume a REST service.
. Click Deploy, and the execute the flow:
+
* Click Copy Link.
* Paste the link in a browser or client.
* Add a prefix to the URL: *https://*.
* Add a suffix to the URL */tls-listener*.
+
The output, a list of REST service users for example, appears in the browser.
